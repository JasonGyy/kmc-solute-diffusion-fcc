effective_interaction_distance	first
#	"first" ==> interaction only considers first nearest neighbour
#	in this simulation, the available options are only: "first", "second", "third"
#	so, if want to consider up to 2nd nearest neighbour distance, type:
#	effective_interaction_distance	second

# total of 100,000 KMC steps will be performed

dump_snapshot	5	1	2
#   produce CFG files (readable in OVITO and AtomEye) for solute type 1 and 2 every 50 KMC steps 
#   CFG files are stored in folder 'dump_snapshot'
#   implicitly also, the state of simulation is produced in a logfile found 
#	in subfolder 'log' every 50 KMC steps
